Some really good questions came from the AMA, they are captured below along with the answers:

**Q: Do you have tips for people applying to the CFP for the first time?**

A: It really depends on your target audience. Focus on your area of expertise and hone in to your target audience. Talks explaining the basics might be applicable for newcomers. Professional and more experienced audience will want more in depth, deep dive type of talks.

**Q: How should I make my abstract more attractive and stand out?**

A: First step is know your target audience. The abstract should detail the idea and highlight the outcome. Explain what will the audience learn from your talk, what is under the hood? Why should they be interested? Use technology keywords.
 
**Q: Are there any special considerations for accepting lightning talks?**

A: Lightning talks are best for narrow topics due to the short limit of time. Topic should be kept specific because you need to communicate the idea quickly while keeping it useful to the audience
 
**Q: Can we share our proposal with the committee for review before making the submission?**

A: The review committee consist of volunteers within the community who also hold full time jobs. Responses depend on their availability, engagement level and commitment is not guaranteed.
 
**Q: Are there sample submissions we can use for inspiration?**

A: Proposals accepted in previous year’s event might be of help.  DevOps World 2020 on demand videos are link:https://www.cloudbees.com/devops-world/sessions[HERE]. Click on the session title to access the abstract.
